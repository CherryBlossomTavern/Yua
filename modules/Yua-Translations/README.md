# Yua-Translations

Yua-Translations is the official translation repository for Yua, we want to be able to bring the best experience to the largest possible margin of users, thus multiple language support.

Please note the following: command names, permissions, and aliases will not translate. Due to simplicity, we will only be translating what we feel is most important
